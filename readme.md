# Mirror Coding Problem
Coding Excersie to Direct Light through a Maze

## Getting Started
This is a standard node.js project with a package.json. 
* `run npm install` to download the necessary packages ('file reader')
* There is no nvmrc file. Here are the versions if a run time issue occurs.
* node - v13.7.0
* npm - 6.13.6
* develped on a mac*

### Prerequisites & Executing
I did not have time to develop input parameters. Therefore, update the "definition-file.txt" with the proper test file.
* To test processing execute `npm run start`
* Assuming the repo has been downlaoded and you have navigated to the directory.

### Disclaimer & Incomplete System
Below is the only truly working portion of the system. The basic file processing and setup is complete. Creating the algorithim or "process logic" still needs to be implemented.

I have outlined the necessary work on the "setup-lazer-mase.js" file, but it still needs to be implemented.

```
-----Required Output-----
Board Dimensions: 5,4 

Lazer Start Position: [123,1204] 

Lazer Strat Orientation: Vertically 
```

* After this point it is fake/stubbed.
